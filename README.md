#### Plan:
To plot the locations of volcanoes around the world.

#### Key Skills/Technologies used:
* [Python](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Other%20Files/Skills%20and%20Tech/Python.md)
    * Geopandas

* [World Map Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/)

#### Notes:
* Goal was for map to be more functional than artistic.
* Used orange instead of red for points to make the map more colour blind friendly.
* Volcano data is from 2021 so the map could be improved by repeating with more up to date data.

* [Data Downloads](https://github.com/ukcp-data/ukcp-spatial-files/tree/master/spatial-files)

#### Notes:
* Goal was for the map to be more artistic than functional.
* No difference in information displayed between the two maps - purely aesthetic changes.
* Wind speed data doesn't seem to be responding correctly with colour mapping - might be issues with data used (area for improvements).

#### Notes:
* Goal was for map to be more functional than artistic - showing deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest by state within the country of Brazil.
* Might be more interesting to explore this again with smaller sections for the choropleth overlay (even areas by km2 for example?)

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/51.2765/30.2712)

#### Notes:
* Goal was for map to be more artistic than functional.
* Initial hope was to focus on the river specifically but was unsure how to use code to fill the outlines of the water produced by osmnx.
* Map did not appear very clear with only waterways so new map focusing on streets was produced.
* Could have been improved by overlaying the streets and the water outlines on the same image.
* Could have also used an illustration software such as Autodesk Sketchbook to fill in the water shapes to make those sections clearer.

* Mafadi clipped raster [Code](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Code/Day%2007%20-%20Raster%20Alternative.ipynb)

#### Notes:
* Initial attempt had difficulties with installing the required python packages needed to clip the DEM file down to the target (Mafadi mountain).
This meant I had to change from making the map any level of functional to artistic.
* Unhappy with this outcome I tried again the next day by using QGIS to clip the DEM before returning to python to complete the new map.

#### Notes:
* [Prettymaps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps) appears to have a common problem where it cannot be installed however someone has built a web app based on the package (Prettymapp).
* Used the web app to build the map which focuses on Spaghetti Junction, Birmingham.
* No code used however above file details settings used in the web app to reproduce this map.

10. ### A bad map

Interactive [Map](https://vikkiwalls.github.io/30-Day-Map-Challenge-live-maps-/badplot.html)

![Map of the world using the conic equal area projection in white and grey with the UK in orange. Map title reads "Countries where it is Illegal to Suspiciously Handle Fish"](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Maps/Day%2010%20-%20Bad%20map.png "Day 10 - Bad Map")

#### Plan:

#### Code and Data:
* [Code](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Code/Day%2010%20-%20Bad%20Map.ipynb)
* [Data](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Self%20Gathered%20Data/badmap.csv)

#### Notes:
In 1986 the UK introduced the [Salmon Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/62/section/32) which makes it illegal to "handle salmon suspiciously".
There is in fact a [valid reason](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-handling-a-salmon-suspiciously-illegal-in-Britain) for this slightly eccentric sounding law but I thought it would be fun to use it as the basis of my map.

* [Champagne Region Boundary Source](https://vineyards.com/wine-map/france)

#### Notes:
* Map is primarily artistic rather than functional.
* Used Autodesk Sketchbook to manipulate the dimensions of the Champagne region boundary map to match the raster dimensions.
* Overlayed the manipulated image over the raster in QGIS to create a template for a polygon shapefile layer, which was then used to clip the raster.
* Transferred clipped raster to python environment to complete the map.
* Colour scheme extracted from an image of a glass of champagne.

#### Plan:
Plot the locations that Dolly Parton has sung on stage.

#### Key Skills/Technologies used:
* [Python](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Other%20Files/Skills%20and%20Tech/Python.md)
    * pandas

* [Concert Locations](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/30-Day-Map-Challenge-2022/blob/main/Self%20Gathered%20Data/Dolly%20Parton%20Stage%20Visits.csv)
* [Dolly Parton Concert Archive](https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/dolly-parton--2#years-section)

#### Notes:
* OpenStreetMap used to find lat/long values for each concert venue.
    * Data goes from 1972 to 2007 - Concert archive has data up until the present but after more than 4 hrs to gather the data for the  first 185 concerts, and with another 219 to take me to the present day, it was taking too long to gather the data.
Hence the map does not show data from 2008-2022.
* This map could be really interesting though and the completed dataset is worth sharing on my public dataset [repo](https://github.com/VikkiWalls/Data-Sources) so I'll probably come back to it.
* Might also be interesting to play with the hexabin size a bit more.
* Colour scheme inspired by Dolly Parton's [website](https://dollyparton.com/)
* Might be a cool project so set up a repo for doing these kinds of maps for lots of different artists...
